          You've probably already read elsewhere the shocking news: croissants
          weren't invented in France. (Ok, you're probably just curious about
          the factoid, but never mind). As with every aspect of tracing the
          croissant's tortuous history, however, it's actually a bit more
          complicated than that. Most food historians trace the origins of the
          croissant to Austria and elsewhere in Eastern Europe, where small
          pastries called kipferl had been made since at least the 13th century,
          according to numerous records.
