          You've probably already read elsewhere the shocking news: croissants
          weren't invented in France.
          <br />
          (Ok, you're probably just curious about the factoid, but never mind).
          <br />
          As with every aspect of tracing the croissant's tortuous history,
          however, it's actually a bit more complicated than that.
          <br />
          Most food historians trace the origins of the croissant to Austria and
          elsewhere in Eastern Europe, where small pastries called
          <span> kipferl </span> had been made since at least the 13th century,
          according to numerous records.
